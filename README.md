# My Portfolio Site!

## Motivation
My motivation for writing my personal site was to have a good place for people to get in touch with me after giving talks. Also, I don't get many excuses to write static sites so this was pretty fun!

## Code Style
I stick to standard.js for JavaScript

## Features
The interactive polka-dot background's CSS was definitely a challenge. 

## Stack
