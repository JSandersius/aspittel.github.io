  h2 Hi, I'm Ali!
  p I'm a DevOps engineer in Washington, DC for #[a(href="https://0ptimus.com/team/alison-spittel/") 0ptimus Consulting]. On a day to day basis I work on both the front and backend of applications in #[mark.blue.lighten-4 Django] and #[mark.pink.lighten-5 Ruby on Rails]. Recently, I've been learning #[mark.orange.lighten-4 React.js], #[mark.red.lighten-4 Elm], #[mark.purple.lighten-4 Django Channels], and #[mark.green.lighten-4 UI/UX design strategies]. When I'm not working you can find me watching my favorite New England sports teams, reading up on Senate races, taking runs around Capitol Hill, or participating in DC coding community events.
