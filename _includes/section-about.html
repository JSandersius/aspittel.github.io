<section class="about" id="about"><div class="circular"></div><h2>Hi, I'm Ali!</h2><p>I'm a DevOps engineer in Washington, DC for <a href="https://0ptimus.com/team/alison-spittel/">0ptimus Consulting</a>. On a day to day basis I work on both the front and backend of applications in <mark class="blue lighten-4">Django</mark> and <mark class="pink lighten-5">Ruby on Rails</mark>. Recently, I've been learning <mark class="orange lighten-4">React.js</mark>, <mark class="red lighten-4">Elm</mark>, <mark class="purple lighten-4">Django Channels</mark>, and <mark class="green lighten-4">UI/UX design strategies</mark>. When I'm not working you can find me watching my favorite New England sports teams, reading up on Senate races, taking runs around Capitol Hill, or participating in DC coding community events. </p></section>
